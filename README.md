This is a project i'm currently working on for my robotics class where I'm using the BRAT bidedal kit and a BotBoarduino microcontroller to have a semi-autonomous bipedal robot 
capable of walking using a cyclic gait. It uses a ping sensor to detect objects within a certain radius of the robots body and avoid it by turning left (for now).
